# Application that Predicts Student Dropout


## Project Overview

This project addresses the critical issue of identifying at-risk students who are likely to drop out of educational institutions. By leveraging data-driven insights, the application aims to enable early interventions to support student retention and improve educational outcomes.

## Key Features

- **At-Risk Student Prediction:** Utilizes a machine learning model to analyze student data and predict the likelihood of dropouts.
- **Early Intervention Strategies:** Provides insights to educational institutions for timely interventions based on the predicted risk factors.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Developed with Flask to ensure easy accessibility and interaction for users.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning Framework:** Scikit-learn
- **Web Framework:** Flask

## Model Development

The machine learning model was developed using historical student data, which includes various features such as academic performance, attendance records, and demographic information. The model has been trained to identify patterns associated with student dropouts.

### Steps Taken:

1. **Data Collection:** Gathered relevant datasets from educational institutions.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and transformed the data to make it suitable for model training.
3. **Model Training:** Implemented various algorithms using Scikit-learn to find the best model for predicting student dropouts.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
5. **Web Application Development:** Built a Flask application to serve the model predictions and provide an interactive user experience.

## Future Work

- Integrate additional features to enhance prediction accuracy.
- Develop a comprehensive dashboard for administrators to visualize dropout trends and statistics.
- Conduct user testing to gather feedback and improve the application.
